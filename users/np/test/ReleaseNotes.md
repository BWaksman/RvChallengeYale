1. The codes below assume Mathematica 10.0
1. Mathematica in version control can be a little annoying since it 
caches results, puts in time stamps etc that all change. If I haven't made
significant changes, I tend to revert back to the old version. There are ways to clean
this up... but these are really here only for prototyping.


Notes
-----

* pmc3.nb : First version with a Gaussian mixture model and a proper EM step. It's 
  still crude, but it mostly works on the simple case.
* pmc2.nb : More playing around, better results. Still only a single component 
  model
* pmc1.nb : Initial playing around, mostly didn't work
